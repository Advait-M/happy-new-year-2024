# Happy New Year!
A little ASCII art terminal program to wish Happy New Year with fireworks ðŸŽ†! Cheers to 2024!

**How to run:** Simply run `python3 happy_new_year.py` after `pip3 install asciimatics`

Note: I've modified certain components of `asciimatics` (particles/effects) since the stars/fireworks effects don't support transparent backgrounds (default terminal background) out-of-the-box for asciimatics.
